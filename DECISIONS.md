# Decisions

A dated log of design decisions for THEMA — what we chose, and why. Append-only: newest entries
go at the bottom, and superseded decisions stay put with a note pointing at the entry that
replaced them.

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — <decision>`, followed by a short rationale.

## 2026-08-21 — Project scaffold

- **Python 3.12** (`requires-python = ">=3.12"`) — broadest wheel coverage across the
  bioinformatics stack (numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels) while still allowing modern typing
  syntax.
- **uv + hatchling, src layout** — `src/thema/` keeps the installed package distinct from the
  repo root, so tests exercise the built package rather than accidentally importing from cwd.
- **ruff enforces the conventions** — the rule set includes `D` (docstrings, google convention)
  and `ANN` (type annotations) so "type hints everywhere, docstrings on public functions" is
  machine-checked rather than review-only. `tests/` is exempt from both.
- **`uv.lock` is committed** — THEMA is a tool, not a library dependency; reproducible resolution
  matters more than floating versions.
